Professors Catherine Pfaff, Sumon Majumdar, and Robert McKeown team up to deliver GAMES: A Gentle Approach to Math, Excel, and Stats. These courses are designed for a diverse set of learners and students &mdash; some of whom may lack a strong background in math and stats from High School &mdash; to prepare them for success at university in business, economics, and the social sciences; Each course is divided into 2-3 segments and 12 modules to allow for a customized experience; This project is made possible with funding by the Government of Ontario and through eCampusOntario’s support of the Virtual Learning Strategy; To learn more about the Virtual Learning Strategy visit: https://vls.ecampusontario.ca/.

<font size="+2">Who is this course for?</font>

This course is for a diverse set of learners in business, economics, and other social sciences including (a) those who may lack a strong enough math and statistics background from high school, (b) learners seeking to refresh their math and statistics knowledge in preparation for upper years in university and college, (c) learners wishing to re-skill or up-skill by switching majors or adding a minor and lacking the necessary math and statistics tools.


<font size="+2">What does this course cover?</font>

The course has two segments.

Segment 1 covers precalculus algebra. These topics are necessary for performing mathematical calculations and higher-level mathematics. It can be useful to think of algebra as a language with its own definitions and rules. Topics are introduced assuming the learner has forgotten all their high school math. We begin by relating algebraic expressions to real world examples from the social sciences. These examples demonstrate the utility of mathematics to motivate the learner as more technical topics are introduced. Sets and real numbers are explored, followed by exponents, factors, and fractions. These mathematical concepts are illustrated using two-dimensional graphs, and their applications are demonstrated with real-world examples whenever possible. Functions and summation notation are important tools for relating real-world phenomena to mathematics in a way that is useful for analysis and simplifies communication.

Segment 2 introduces differential calculus which is perhaps the most commonly used mathematical concept in business and the social sciences. We begin by introducing the concept of limits: the value of a function as the input variable moves closer and closer to some particular number. Limits help understand the concept of differentiation which is in turn used to calculate rates of change for expressions more complicated than a straight line. We develop the important idea that on a graph, differentiation equates to the slope of a curve. We then explore three useful applications of differential calculus: implicit differentiation, linear approximation, and optimization.

Each module relies on at least some of the topics covered in a previous module, so we suggest that the learner work through each module in sequence. A learner who has not mastered the content in part 1 is likely to be challenged to develop even a basic understanding of the content in part 2.


<font size="+2">Learning objectives</font>

By following the lectures and attempting the embedded and practice questions, the learner should be able to:

Model real-world phenomena as an equation and inequality.
Demonstrate an understanding of the basics of limits and summation notation.
Create a two-dimensional diagram to represent the mathematical relationship between two variables, both by hand and using Excel or another spreadsheet program.
Identify all points of interest on a diagram including the axes labels, slopes, and intercepts.
Identify expressions that are implicit functions and apply implicit differentiation to find the slope of these expressions.
Use linear approximation to approximate the level of a variable and its rate of change.
Convert a word problem into a mathematical optimization problem and solve this optimization problem.

<font size="+2">Course Resources</font>

Students have access to the following course resources:

Close-captioned lecture videos
Embedded questions (with solutions) in the lecture videos to encourage retention and provide immediate feedback
Full lecture transcripts
Blank and annotated lecture slides
Practice problems, including some computations with spreadsheet software such as Excel / Google sheets (provided in both .xls and .ods formats)
Solutions to the practice problems, including Excel computations (provided in both .xls and .ods formats)
