Professors Catherine Pfaff, Sumon Majumdar, and Robert McKeown team up to deliver GAMES: A Gentle Approach to Math, Excel, and Stats. These two 12-week courses are designed to prepare a diverse set of learners and students, some of whom may lack a strong background in math and stats from High School, to succeed in university business, economics, and the social sciences; Each course was divided into two or three segments and 12 modules to allow for a customized experience; This project was made possible with funding by the Government of Ontario and through eCampusOntario’s support of the Virtual Learning Strategy.
